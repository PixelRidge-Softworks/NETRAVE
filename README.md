## Introduction
Welcome to NETRAVE, a cybersecurity solution designed to provide a high level of security, vigilance, and response to threats, ensuring that network environments remain secure and resilient. This README provides a comprehensive overview of the software, its purpose, functions, objectives, and unique methods of handling issues/challenges.

## About NETRAVE
NETRAVE is an acronym for Network Environment for Threat Response and Advanced Vulnerability Extermination. It is a modular cybersecurity software that aims to provide a high level of security, vigilance, and response to threats, ensuring that network environments remain secure and resilient. 

## About the Developer
Connor Crawford, also known as Vetheon, is the developer behind NETRAVE. With over 8 years of experience in the private sector, Connor has a wealth of knowledge and expertise in software development, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity. Recognizing the need for more transparency and open-source solutions in cybersecurity, he began producing open-source software, with NETRAVE being one of his first flagship projects.

## Technical Overview
NETRAVE is designed with a modular architecture, which allows for easy customization, upgrades, and maintenance. Each module in NETRAVE is designed to perform a specific function, and they can work independently or in harmony, depending on the needs of the user. 

The software is built using Ruby, a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes simplicity and productivity. Ruby's dynamic typing and object-oriented design make it an ideal choice for a modular system like NETRAVE.

## Modular Design
The modular design of NETRAVE is one of its key features. Each module is designed to perform a specific function, and they can work independently or in harmony, depending on the needs of the user. This design allows for easy customization, upgrades, and maintenance. 

The modular design also allows for easy expansion. New modules can be added to the system as needed, providing additional functionality without disrupting the existing system. This flexibility makes NETRAVE a scalable solution that can adapt to the changing needs of a network environment.
