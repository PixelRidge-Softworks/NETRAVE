## Introduction
Welcome to NETRAVE, a cybersecurity solution designed to provide a high level of security, vigilance, and response to threats, ensuring that network environments remain secure and resilient. This README provides a comprehensive overview of the software, its purpose, functions, objectives, and unique methods of handling issues/challenges.

## About NETRAVE
NETRAVE is an acronym for Network Environment for Threat Response and Advanced Vulnerability Extermination. It is a modular cybersecurity software that aims to provide a high level of security, vigilance, and response to threats, ensuring that network environments remain secure and resilient.

## About the Developer
Connor Crawford, also known as Vetheon, is currently the only developer behind NETRAVE. With over 8 years of experience in the private sector, Connor has a wealth of knowledge and expertise in software development, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity. Recognizing the need for more transparency and open-source solutions in cybersecurity, he began producing open-source software, with NETRAVE being one of his first flagship projects and his first ever large project written in Ruby.

## Technical Overview
NETRAVE is designed with a modular architecture, which allows for easy customization, upgrades, and maintenance. Each module in NETRAVE is designed to perform a specific function, and they can work independently or in harmony, depending on the needs of the user.

The software is built using Ruby, a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes simplicity and productivity. Ruby's dynamic typing and object-oriented design make it an ideal choice for a modular system like NETRAVE.

Recent updates include the implementation of a secure sudo system, and the creation of a NetworkingGenie class to handle network interface setup and traffic mirroring. The AlertQueueManager class has also been updated to use a standard Array queue instead of a Ring Buffer for managing the queue of alerts.

## Modular Design
The modular design of NETRAVE is one of its key features. Each module is designed to perform a specific function, and they can work independently or in harmony, depending on the needs of the user. This design allows for easy customization, upgrades, and maintenance.

The modular design also allows for easy expansion. New modules can be added to the system as needed, providing additional functionality without disrupting the existing system. This flexibility makes NETRAVE a scalable solution that can adapt to the changing needs of a network environment.

## Contributing
NETRAVE is an open-source project, and contributions are welcome. If you're interested in contributing, please fork the repository and make your changes. Once you're done, submit a pull request. All contributions, no matter how small, are greatly appreciated.

If you're looking for something to do, you can have a look in our [TODO List](https://github.com/Pixelated-Studios/NETRAVE/blob/main/TODO.md)

## Contact
Connor is always open to receiving questions. If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to say hi, you can reach him at vetheon@pixelatedstudios.net or on discord via VetheonGames#0001.

## Conclusion
NETRAVE is a robust, modular cybersecurity solution that provides a high level of security, vigilance, and response to threats. Its open-source nature and modular design make it a flexible and adaptable solution that can meet the changing needs of any network environment. Whether you're a network administrator looking for a comprehensive security solution, or a developer interested in contributing to an open-source project, NETRAVE has something to offer you.
